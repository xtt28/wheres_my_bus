#+AUTHOR: xtt28

** Project description

REST API that tells you where your BCA bus is.

** Application design

- Bus data is parsed from BCA bus location spreadsheet
  - Data is cached after being requested
  - If it is between the hours of 12:25 and 12:50 or 4:05 and 4:30, cache TTL is
    one minute
  - Otherwise, cache TTL is five minutes
- Served from JSON REST API

** Endpoints
